## Legal

SoLoud, [like everything else](http://everythingisaremix.info/), stands on the shoulders of giants;
however, care has been taken to only incorporate source code that is
under liberal licenses, namely ZLib/LibPNG, CC0 or public domain, or
similar, like WTFPL or Unlicense, where you don't need to include
mention of the code in your documentation or splash screens or any such
nonsense.

Any patches submitted to SoLoud must agree to be under compatible licenses.

### SoLoud Proper


SoLoud proper is licensed under the ZLib/LibPNG license. The code is a
clean-room implementation with no outside sources used.

       3. This notice may not be removed or altered from any source

### OGG Support


The OGG support in the Wav and WavStream sound sources is based on
stb_vorbis by Sean Barrett, and it's in the public domain. You can find
more information (and latest version) at
<http://nothings.org/stb_vorbis/>

### MP3 Support

The MP3 support in the Wav and Wavstream sound sources is based on
dr_mp3.h by David Reid, and released under Unlicense. dr_mp3.h itself
is based on minimp3 is released under CC0 public domain license.

### Wav Support

Various wav file formats are loaded using dr_wav.h by David Reid,
which is released under Unlicense.

### Speech Synthesizer


The speech synth is based on rsynth by the late Nick Ing-Simmons (et
al). He described the legal status as:

        This is a text to speech system produced by
        integrating various pieces of code and tables
        of data, which are all (I believe) in the
        public domain.

Since then, the rsynth source code has passed legal checks by several
open source organizations, so it "should" be pretty safe.

The primary copyright claims seem to have to do with text-to-speech
dictionary use, which I've removed completely.

I've done some serious refactoring, clean-up and feature removal on the
source, as all I need is "a" free, simple speech synth, not a "good"
speech synth. Since I've removed a bunch of stuff, this is probably
safer public domain release than the original.

I'm placing my changes in public domain as well, or if that's not
acceptable for you, then CC0:
<http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>.

The SoLoud interface files (soloud_speech.\*) are under the same
ZLib/LibPNG license as the other SoLoud bits.

### Vizsn

The vizsn speech synthesizer is copyright Ville-Matias Heikkil&auml;,
released under WTFPL (in short, "do what you want to").


### Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)


FFT calculation is based on fftreal by Laurent de Soras, under WTFPL, which
lets you do whatever you want with it.

### Sfxr


The sfxr sound effects synthesizer is by Tomas Pettersson, re-licensed under
zlib/libpng license by permission.

### RPGMaker Wrapper Generator

The RPGMaker wrapper generator contains code copied from the Ruby standard
library. This is permitted by the rule 4 of the Ruby license:

\pagebreak

    Ruby is copyrighted free software by Yukihiro Matsumoto <matz@netlab.jp>.
    You can redistribute it and/or modify it under either the terms of the
    2-clause BSDL (see the file BSDL), or the conditions below:
    
      1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
         software without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the
         original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.
    
      2. You may modify your copy of the software in any way, provided that
         you do at least ONE of the following:
    
           a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise
              make them Freely Available, such as by posting said
    	  modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or by allowing
    	  the author to include your modifications in the software.
    
           b) use the modified software only within your corporation or
              organization.
    
           c) give non-standard binaries non-standard names, with
              instructions on where to get the original software distribution.
    
           d) make other distribution arrangements with the author.
    
      3. You may distribute the software in object code or binary form,
         provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
    
           a) distribute the binaries and library files of the software,
    	  together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent)
    	  on where to get the original distribution.
    
           b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
    	  the software.
    
           c) give non-standard binaries non-standard names, with
              instructions on where to get the original software distribution.
    
           d) make other distribution arrangements with the author.
    
      4. You may modify and include the part of the software into any other
         software (possibly commercial).  But some files in the distribution
         are not written by the author, so that they are not under these terms.
    
         For the list of those files and their copying conditions, see the
         file LEGAL.
    
      5. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as 
         output from the software do not automatically fall under the
         copyright of the software, but belong to whomever generated them, 
         and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
         software.
    
      6. THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
         IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
         WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
         PURPOSE.

In any case, the RPGMaker wrapper does not claim to be Ruby or part of Ruby,
and the wrapper generator and the wrapper itself is public and freely
available, so that license should be covered many times over.
