    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader screenquad = sg_make_shader(screenquad_screenquad_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs.images[] or .fs.images[]

    Sampler bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs.sampler[] or .fs.samplers[]

        SLOT_screenquad_smp = 0;

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'vs_params':

        screenquad_vs_params_t vs_params = {
